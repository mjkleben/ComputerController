# ComputerController
Use a script that controlls another computer via Command Prompt.

In order to use the Computer Controller, open the Receiver.py script on the computer that you want to control and open the Sender.py script on the computer that you want to be the controller. 

The code for Pyrebase was derived from https://github.com/thisbejim/Pyrebase and put into the scripts in an attempt to convert them into executables. However, there is a problem with Pyinstaller and other Python installers that could not successfully convert them to .exe files.
